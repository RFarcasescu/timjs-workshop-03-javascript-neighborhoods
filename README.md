* cmd/GitBash on Windows
* any terminal on Linux.

### 1. Create project folder

First, you need to create a new folder somewhere on your computer:

```
mkdir [PROJECT_NAME]
cd [PROJECT_NAME]

// or create a new "project folder" and navigate to it using your favourite file system tool
```

### 2. Clone project skeleton

Second, you need to clone this repository. You can do it in multiple ways:

__a) with git:__
```
git clone https://github.com/andreipfeiffer/timjs-workshop-03-javascript-neighborhoods.git ./
```

NOTE: if you have a GitHub account, you can fork this repo, so you can commit your personal changes.

__b) without git:__

__[Download][download_repo]__ this repo and unzip it in your PROJECT_NAME folder.



### 3. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### 4. Run project

```
npm start
```

This should display a URL in the console, where you can load the project page.
